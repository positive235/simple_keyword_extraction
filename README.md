The sweetness and crunch was so satisfying and not too sweet, not to mention they were beautifully made and topped with a mountain of cool whip (I love cool whip). The balance of Carmel and coffee doesn’t always work out, and is often too sweet, but I could not put it down. The service was amazing and I wish I could just say thank you to the man in the windows! I would definitely recommend adding the crunch to your next Carmel Frappe, it was divine.
